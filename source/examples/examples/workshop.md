We have put together contents for a full day workshop that teaches how to test a modern web application using Cypress. You can preview the slides here: {% url https://gitpitch.com/cypress-io/testing-workshop-cypress#/ https://gitpitch.com/cypress-io/testing-workshop-cypress#/ %}

The repository {% url "cypress-io/testing-workshop-cypress" https://github.com/cypress-io/testing-workshop-cypress %} has an example application, test exercises (with answers), and speaker slides with notes. The content should be a good starting point for anyone who wants to learn Cypress or teach it to others. The exercises cover the following topics (see the workshop's {% url "README file" https://github.com/cypress-io/testing-workshop-cypress#readme %} for an exact list).

- How to install and run Cypress
- Writing and running a basic test
- Setting up video recording and screenshots
- Using the Selector Playground
- Testing XHR requests
- Using data fixtures to mock data
- Running tests on CI and recording to the Dashboard
- Customizing your own reporters
- Writing custom Cypress commands
- Debugging in Cypress
- Component testing

We hope this testing workshop proves itself useful in teaching developers and testers good Cypress practices.

# ReactJSDay 2019 Testing Course

{% imgTag /img/examples/reactjsday-course.png "ReactJS Day" %}

This is the {% url "reference repository" https://github.com/NoriSte/reactjsday-2019-testing-course %} with all the contents and the examples of the {% url "React Testing 101: component, integration, and end-to-end testing" https://2019.reactjsday.it/workshops/react-testing-101.html %}  course for the {% url "ReactJSDay 2019" https://2019.reactjsday.it/ %} conference.

The repository aims to be consumed through {% url "the compiled GitBook" https://noriste.github.io/reactjsday-2019-testing-course/ %}. The course starts from the peak of the testing pyramid and goes down instead of following the "standard" testing path, you can {% url "read here" https://noriste.github.io/reactjsday-2019-testing-course/book/top-to-bottom.html %} the reason why. {% url "Some introductory slides" https://slides.com/noriste/reactjsday-2019-testing-course %} are also included but they're only useful for the teacher, they're a summary of the content presented before the coding session.


Additional requisites to run the project and the tests on your local machine:

- Node 10+
- {% url "MongoDB" https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/#tutorials %}
- {% url "Docker" https://docs.docker.com/install/ %}
